# Hackathon
This is a project for YHack for the Environmental Impact-to-action design. 
The description for Earth Hacks is: Design a hack or tool that you would use to educate someone who denies the science of climate change.
Our Design:
An educational website geared towards children whose parents/guardians do not believe in climate change. The website provides interactions
between these children who might have any climate change questions and climate change experts who can answer them.
